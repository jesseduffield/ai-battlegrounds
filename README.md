# AI Battlegrounds

It's about time we put LLM's in an ACTUAL arena. In this turn-based 2D grid game, AI agents explore, fight, cooperate, and deceive, to survive.

If you're looking for a new way to test the agentic abilities of LLM's, or if you want to design some torturous Squid-Game-esque scenarios that pit agents against eachother, this is the place to do it.

## Features

- **Grid-based world** with buildings, paths, and items
- **AI-driven characters** Powered by OpenAI's models (BYO API key)
- **Imperfect information** - characters only know what they've seen or heard
- **Blood contracts** - agents can sign contracts with eachother to enforce agreements, and if either party violates the contract, they will be struck dead by the Great Judge.
- **Level editor** - Come up with your own contrived situations to see how the AI's behave.
- **Enter the game yourself** - Play as a character and see if you can manipulate the AI's to achieve your goals.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

# Work in progress

Although this is certainly at MVP stage, it's very much a work in progress.

## Donate

I blew 500 bucks on Opus 4.5 writing the code for this, so PLEASE consider donating [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield)
