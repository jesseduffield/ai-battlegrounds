It's about time we put LLM's in an ACTUAL arena. In this turn-based 2D grid game, AI agents explore, fight, cooperate, and deceive, to survive.

If you're looking for a new way to test the agentic abilities of LLM's, or if you want to design some torturous Squid-Game-esque scenarios that pit agents against eachother, this is the place to do it.

## Features

- **AI-driven characters** Powered by OpenAI's models (BYO API key)
- **Imperfect information** - Characters only know what they've seen or heard
- **Blood contracts** - Agents can sign contracts with eachother to enforce agreements, and if either party violates the contract, they will be struck dead by the Great Judge.
- **Level editor** - Come up with your own contrived situations to see how the AI's behave.
- **Enter the game yourself** - Play as a character and see if you can manipulate the AI's to achieve your goals.

Guys, the sky is the limit with this stuff. You really can create some crazy shit in this system.

## Work in progress

Although this is certainly at MVP stage, it's very much a work in progress.

## Donate

I blew 500 bucks on Opus 4.5 writing the code for this, so PLEASE consider donating [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield)
